# Book Search Engine

The Book Search Engine has been converted from using a RESTful API to a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. It lets the user sign up and log in to save books they query. It is using the Google Books API in the back end and serving it up with GraphQL to the front end.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Must have a web browser with internet connection.

### Usage

Search for a book on the search bar. Results will show up after you submit search. In order to save a book, the user must create an account and be logged in. Whenever a user is logged in, the user now has the option to save the book by clicking the '<code>Save this Book!</code>' button. To view you saved books, the user must be logged in and click the link on the top right that says '<code>See Your Books</code>'. If the user has books saved, they have the option to remove them.
